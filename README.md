Open Bad Waldsee switchboard

the Bad Waldsee switchboard is the software for the model railroad switchboard of our model railroads club SPEAK located in Foehrenwaeldli in Switzerland.
in the software, mostly the types SpDr60 of German railway (DB) and DOMINO55 from the Swiss railway (SBB) are described.

the software is made flexible so on each station it can be the same. The settings are given in a configuratin file that is parsed by the software.
the Hardware is described in the book 'Raspberry Pi steuert Modelleisenbahn' by Kurt Zerzawy, available at www.elektor.de or other shops.
since only the hardware layer really depends on the book, the software is interesting for everyone who want to realise a switchboard for his model railroad.
